# issue-prioritiser
A tool that analyzes GitHub issues and ranks them by priority and contributor-friendliness using NLP and metadata.

## Tech stack

- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: React
- Database: PostgreSQL (SQLite for local development)
- Others: Docker (for deployment, later)

## Planned features

- Connect a GitHub repository and fetch open issues.
- Score issues by priority and contributor-friendliness.
- Dashboard to filter and sort issues by score.
- Explanations for why each issue received its score.

## Getting started

Project setup is in progress.

Planned structure:

- `backend/` – FastAPI API for fetching and scoring issues.
- `frontend/` – React dashboard for viewing issues.

Once the initial structure is ready, this section will include install and run commands.
